### Decision Tree Creation
- Our proprietary algorithms process legal documentation from various rights laws, extending beyond consumer protection legislation, to generate structured decision tree formats
- These decision trees provide logical interpretability and serve as guidance frameworks for large language model responses

### Advanced Data Management
The application includes sophisticated data processing capabilities as shown in the tree traversal interface, purposed for business-facing diagnostics team.

## Key Components

### Screening Process
The application guides users through a structured screening process:

1. **Eligibility Check** - Confirms UK consumer protection applicability
2. **Contract Classification** - Identifies the type of purchase/contract
3. **Purchase Method** - Determines how the transaction occurred
4. **Date Collection** - Records when goods/services were received
5. **Issue Description** - Captures the user's problem in their own words

### Content Filtering System
- **Automatic Processing**: AI filters user descriptions to remove bias
- **Privacy Protection**: Strips personal identifying information
- **Transparency**: Shows both original and filtered versions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful handling of API failures

## Document hierarchical traversal
- **Human methodology-based**: the document is traversed in a hierarchical zoom out-in manner, mimicking the thought process of a lawyer reading the document.
- **Restricted LLM reliance** Decision made by the LLM agent are strictly grid locked into smaller, compartmentalised decisions.
- **Reproducable and Interpretable**: traversal algorithm enforces reproducable line of thought, which gives interpretable logging of LLM decisions.

## Legal Compliance

This application is prototyped for the UK consumer protection law (but not limited to this use case):

- Focus on Consumer Rights Act 2015
- Distance selling regulations compliance
- Consumer protection from unfair trading regulations
- Goods and services act provisions


**Note**: This application provides general legal guidance and should not replace professional legal advice for complex matters.
